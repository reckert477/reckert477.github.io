          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Questaurant is the result of a dissertation under Xiaofei Tang about game-based formulaic expressions learning. When learning a language, in this case Chinese, knowlege of context, norms, and social conventions is equally important in communication as vocabularly and grammar themselves. However, when learning a second language removed from its native context, conventions of speaking are often lost. Questaurant was thus an experiment for the feasibility of using games to teach such conventions through simulated environments and natural feedback.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge(s)</h3>
          <p>
            Being an experiment, Questaurant had a significant amount of constraints.<br>
            As an educational game, Questaurant already has to take a complex skill and balance the use of internal and external motivators to encourage players to master said skill. Modern educational games often lack an engaging flow as well as overly rely on external motivators, which make for less than stellar learning experiences.<br>
            In addition, being the experiment to a control heavily restricted the avenues in which we could explore interesting interactions and flow. Since control was essentially a digital multiple choice question application, Questaurant had to provide the exact same experience sans “game components”. This created constraints such as giving every player the exact same experience, thereby eliminatng options of branching or extra practice, and limiting questions (moments of skill check) to those that could be written in a multiple choice or similar format. <br>
            One particularly significant challenge we faced was how we would simulate real life contexts. Games are a format that constantly provide feedback to the player so that they can perform their next action, which is a natural fit to simulate feedback one would have gotten simply by interacting within the language's natural context. Regardless, we still run into the question of how we can improve on and create new feeback systems to stimulate learning.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Development began with simultaniously fleshing out ideas for core gameplay mechanic as well as environment. Our team strongly believed that cohesion and alignment between narrative, interaction and learning was critical for player investment, and is unfortunately where many educational games fall short due to the complex nature of language. We went through multiple iterations and ideas, but settled on the concept of "an outdated robot with a malfuntioning language chip" in order to mitigate any possible offense of the portrayal of the Chinese language.
