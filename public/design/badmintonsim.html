            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              The beginning of our project consisted of research in order to identify our goals and how we would go about achieving them. To this we had to understand “What does it mean to play badminton?” and, “What does it mean to emulate the feeling of an activity?”
            </p>
            <p>
              When emulating an activity, we had to identify the core pillars of play, and isolate how those parts would be interpreted by players of different skill levels. All these factors were crucial to replicating the experience of improving at badminton. To achieve this, we played badminton ourselves, received coaching from the badminton team, and interviewed members of the team. From this method, we identified three core pillars of badminton:

                    Shot technique is the largest distinguishing factor of badminton. What sets badminton apart from other racket sports is how much control players have over the shuttlecock, relative to fast-paced badminton is. Beginners are often focused with the bare essentials, returning the bird over the net. Intermediate players start thinking about which shot they should take out of multiple options. Advanced players consider their shots in context of their strategies against their opponents’.

                  <div class="card-body">
                    Spatial awareness is the second most distinguishable factor of badminton. The court is just big enough that it requires players to make a choice between sprinting, lunging, and jumping to get to where the bird is. Players must also pay attention to  where the birdie is in relation to each player and the court. Beginner players are often focused on just getting to the bird and hitting it inside the opponent’s court. Intermediate players are more concerned with where they can place the bird in the opponent’s court such that it is disadvantageous to the opponent. Advanced players consider all of the above, and also how physiologically difficult would it be to reach the bird.

                    Game pacing is the most high level factor of badminton, as it plays mostly into strategy as opposed to physical finesse. Since badminton is so fast, in matches players often have to anticipate shots to ready their stance and form. Due to this, a shot that is counter to the anticipated pacing can catch the opponent off guard and make them play unoptimaly. Beginners hardly think about game pacing whereas intermediate players begin to think about pacing, but can still brute force plays with good technique. This pillar is mostly utilized by advanced players, who have enough mastery over the sport that they need to outplay their opponents in other ways in order to win.

            <h3>Designing the Experience</h3>
            <p>
              Pursuing all three pillars of badminton would have been far out of scope, so we decided to build our experience to train the first two pillars of badminton. I proctored a number of brownbox tests to develop excercises for these pillars that we would be able to implement in VR.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a part of Shot Technique, one our first goals was to get the user aquainted with the racket coordination, so we started off with excercises in placing the racquet head where one typically wants to hit the birdie. From there on, we tried getting users adjusted with reacting to an incoming birdie and translating that into a well timed hit.

            <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              With the design of the experience gaining clarity, there were a number of technical setbacks that impacted how we developed and lead us to comprimise with how we were spending our time and which parts of the experience to prioritize.

                      Collision Detection

                    Regarding collision detection, some context is necessary. Physics calculations in Unity are calculated in fixed intervals, typically 90 updates per second for VR. For a game as fast-paced as badminton, this means that birdie colliders can phase through racquet heads if the collision happens between update intervals. This can be mitigated with collision detection that interpolates. However, if the racquet collider is directly controlled by the player, the interpolation is ineffective because Unity only knows where the racquet is at each update, now how it got there. Instead, I had to create a collider that followed the racquet head, and only then was Unity able to properly register collision detection, because it then knew not only where the head was but how it got there, allowing it to make the necessary calculations.

                    The other significant issue I found was with the impact and the trajectory of the birdie. The aerodynamics of a birdie is very complex due to its unique construction, which is very different from Unity’s default implementation. After a week or two of attempting to simulate the physics, I realized that I had to prioritize in order to reach other aspects of the project. Thus the focus shifted from “emulating badminton physics” to “finding an approximate mathematical function family that was close enough such that players could develop consistency and improve”. This realization and shift of mindset, although late, enabled the project to progress further.

            <h3>Feedback Systems</h3>
            <p>
              The last phase of development, designing feedback systems, was the most experimental. While developing the system, our team realized that we were unable to address some of the key feedback systems that were crucial in the lens of the exergame framework, such as the sound, or the haptic feedback upon birdie impact. We tried to remedy this in two ways. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The first was to look at the relevant body framework and see if there was any stimulus we could apply in lieu of the original stimulus. This worked great for the sensory body, where we could add different types of audio feedback, but less well for the motor control body. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The other method was to look at the information that feedback system were intended to provide to the player and substitute that information through other means. In this case, both audio and haptics were intended to tell how much force was applied to the bird in order to develop consistency in hitting. One way that I was able to remedy this was to add a color trail on the birdie to indicate its  acceleration.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I was attempting to substitute existing feedback systems, I also wanted to experiment with more augmented forms of feedback. For this segment, I took the most common novice and intermediate badminton errors and attempted to implement an augmented feedback that would help curb bad habits at early stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              For novice players, the biggest mistake is the stroke, swinging one’s entire arm instead of just flicking the wrist. We implemented a system that would track the relative velocity of the player’s controller, as well as the head of their racquet. If the simulation detected both were traveling at roughly the same speed, it would give the player a notification to pay attention to their form.
            </p>
            <p>
              For intermediate players, the biggest error is hitting shots that land out of bounds, or put themselves in bad positions. In order to build up the habit of loss-aversion, I implemented a negative feedback on the bridie landing out of bounds via sound effects. While both forms of augmented feedback were rudimentary and not thoroughly tested, they both showed enough initial promise to warrant more investigation on future projects.
