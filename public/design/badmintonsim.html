            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              The beginning of our project consisted of research in order to identify our goals and how we would go about achieving them. To this we had to understand “What does it mean to emulate the feeling of an activity?” and, “What does it mean to play badminton specifically?”
            </p>
            <p>
              For the former, we used the lense of the exergame framework to break down how the body responds to an activity such as badminton. By creating an experience that elicts a similar bodily response to badminton, we can say the that we have emulated the feeling similar playing badminton even if there are differences in the experience itself.

                      The exergame framework, in short, is a means to think about the ways the body experiences exertion through different perspectives, and how use these perspectives to reinforce gameplay. This project loosely uses the interpretation outlined in the paper "Designing Sports: A Framework for Exertion Games" (2011) by Florian 'Floyd' Mueller, Darren Edge, Frank Vetere, Martin Gibbs, Stefan Agamanolis, Bert Bongers, and Jennifer Sheridan. The paper outlines four key pespectives as follows, each with their own implications on how the body responds within the scope of a gamefied activity.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The Responding Body: The responding body describes changes in the player's physiological state as a response to exertion. This includes short term effects such as increased heart rate, presperation, and increased breathing, but also longer term effects such as the building of muscle mass and burning of fats. Games can engage the responding body by encouraging exertion or by sensing changes within the player's responding body.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Moving Body: The moving body more specifically tunes into the relation of muscles and body parts to each other. This lense moreso focus on the player's kinesthetic sense, and manipulating body parts to react to situations and perform actions. Games often engage the moving body by traning specific motor actions that are used throughout the game itself.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Sensing Body: The sensing body focuses on sensory perception and the intepretation of the world in context with the actions the player are executing. This of course referes to the direct sensory input that the body experiences, but also the psycological interpretation of the senses. Games engage the sensing body by requiring the player to interpret the state of the game, as well as interpret how their actions are performing in context to the game.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Relating Body: The relating body refrences social interactions, and how the player's body reacts and relates to other players' bodies and the absence of them. Social aspects and interactions within experiences are diverse have profound effects, such as comradere though cooperative experiences or rivalry through competitive experiences. Engaging in social interactions is often a major motivator and various social interactions can have tangible effects on how the other aspects of the exergame framework. Games utilize the relating body by including multiple players in their rulesets and logic.

              However, aside from the specifics of how the body reacts to the activity of badminton we also needed a general understanding about what makes badminton unique as an activity. These generalized pillars of the activity are required to understand how players interact with the sport and isolate how these pillars would be engaged with by players of different skill levels. All these factors were crucial to replicating the experience of improving at badminton. To achieve this, we played badminton ourselves, received coaching from the badminton team, and interviewed members of the team. From this method, we identified three core pillars of badminton:

                      Shot Technique
                    </button>
                  </h5>
                </div>

                <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordion">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <p>
                      Shot technique is the largest distinguishing factor of badminton. What sets badminton apart from other racket sports is how much control players have over the shuttlecock, relative to fast-paced badminton is. Beginners are often focused with the bare essentials, returning the bird over the net. Intermediate players start thinking about which shot they should take out of multiple options. Advanced players consider their shots in context of their strategies against their opponents’.

                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo">
                  <h5 class="mb-0">

                    <p>
                      Spatial awareness is the second most distinguishable factor of badminton. The court is just big enough that it requires players to make a choice between sprinting, lunging, and jumping to get to where the bird is. Players must also pay attention to  where the birdie is in relation to each player and the court. Beginner players are often focused on just getting to the bird and hitting it inside the opponent’s court. Intermediate players are more concerned with where they can place the bird in the opponent’s court such that it is disadvantageous to the opponent. Advanced players consider all of the above, and also how physiologically difficult would it be to reach the bird.

                    <p>
                      Game pacing is the most high level factor of badminton, as it plays mostly into strategy as opposed to physical finesse. Since badminton is so fast, in matches players often have to anticipate shots to ready their stance and form. Due to this, a shot that is counter to the anticipated pacing can catch the opponent off guard and make them play unoptimaly. Beginners hardly think about game pacing whereas intermediate players begin to think about pacing, but can still brute force plays with good technique. This pillar is mostly utilized by advanced players, who have enough mastery over the sport that they need to outplay their opponents in other ways in order to win.

              Combining the pillars of badminton with the exergame framework means using the pillars of badminton create an experience that elicts bodily responses similar to performing the actual activity (as defined through the exergame framework). However, to perfectly encapsulate both concepts in their entirety is an unrealistic undertaking. With our research in hand, our team decided to create an experience that is able to train players in badminton by scaffolding interactions that help them gain understanding of the pillars of badminton, and elict aspects of the exergame framework that will prepare them for the actual activity.
            </p>

            <h3>Designing the Experience</h3>
            <p>
              To set our scope more explicitly, our team decided to build our experience to train the first two pillars of badminton. Specifically, we wanted to train the player's moving body aspect of the exergame framework, which can be considered the skills required to play the game. I proctored a number of brownbox tests to develop excercises for these pillars that we would be able to implement in VR.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a part of Shot Technique, one our first goals was to get the user aquainted with the racket coordination, so we started off with excercises in placing the racquet head where one typically wants to hit the birdie. From there on, we tried getting users adjusted with reacting to an incoming birdie and translating that into a well timed hit.

            <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              With the design of the experience gaining clarity, there were a number of technical setbacks that impacted how we developed and lead us to comprimise with how we were spending our time and which parts of the experience to prioritize.

                      Collision Detection
                    </button>

                    <p>
                      Having working collision detection is an uncompromisable aspect of our experience. Our team opted to use Unity's in built physics system in order to handle the meat of this problem, which unfortunately put us at the mercy of Unith's physics system implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Physics calculations in Unity are calculated in fixed intervals which can be dictated in the project settings. Projects are typically set at 90 updates per second for VR. For a game as fast-paced as badminton, this means that birdie colliders can phase through racquet heads if the collision happens between update intervals, a common problem due to how thin the raquet head is and how quickly players can swing their controller. Typically can be mitigated with collision detection that interpolates, but the interpolation only works for rigidbodies that are controlled with the physics system. If the racquet collider is directly controlled by the player (is kinematic), the interpolation is ineffective because Unity only knows where the racquet is at each update, now how it got there. The workaround was to create an object that was controlled by the unity physics system, yet was still responsive to player movemement. This intermediary collider was programmed to follow the racquet head, allowing Unity able to properly inerpolate to detect collisions.

                      With collision being properly detected, the next implementation challenge was to determine how the birdie reacted to the collision and how it flies through the air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Immediately our team realized that accurately simulating the trajectory of a birdie was far out of scope. The aerodynamics of a birdie is incredilby complex due to its unique construction, which forced our team to make a design decision about how accurately we needed to simulate the birdie in order to meet the primary design goal of our experience, training the pillars of badminton. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The conclusion that our team came to was that proper simulation was not a primary goal of our experience, and that the simulated needed to be just "good enough" for the understanding of the sport to translate. Many of the variables required for an acurate simulation were already being obscured through the interface of VR, so our team opted to take an interative and playtest-focused approach in order to progress the project. This decision helped reinforce the spirit of the project, which was being obscured through the developmental process.

                      Despite our team being as responsive as possible, the unexpected developmental challenges encountered previously meant that we had limited time to develop framing the experience, requiring us to once again determine what functionality is neccecary fulfil our experience pillars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To recap, the two pillars of badminton that our team wanted to tran were the pillars of "Shot Technique" and "Spacial Awareness". The former is related to training the player's form associated with hiting the birdie, whereas the latter is focused with building the player's understanding of the relation between themselves, the birdie, and the court. Our initial idea was to create an experience that would guild the player through these pillars through structured excercise, but with the time remaining that would be incredibly out of scope. Upon careful deliberation, our team decided to sharply cut back on scope, providing a sandbox that would enable players to self train in the two pillars, and instead focusing on how VR can augment the players experience in ways that are not possible in real life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the first pillar of shot technique, our goal was to enable the player to practice any stroke they wanted such that they can develop consistency in their strokes. The system we developed enabled players to set a birdie spawn relative to their body, such that they could build up muscle memory through repition. For the second pillar of spacial awarenes, we set up targets on the opposite side of the court, placed in locations that are often strategically beneficial in an actual game of badminton. Simple logic was built to detect a shot that was in bounds and valid, a shot that hit a strategic target, and a shot that was out of bouds. The rest of development time for the project was then spent on the feedback that encouraged the proper usage of these systems.

            <h3>Feedback Systems</h3>
            <p>
              The last phase of development, designing feedback systems, was the most experimental. As per the exergame framework, the sensing body is largely how the player evaluates information that helps them perform actions, as well as evaluate the outcomes of said actions. Put simply, we can utilize feedback to help players understand what a good action should feel like by positively reinforcing it, and what bad actions feel like by negatively reinforcing them (with good and bad pertaining to how well they align to the original activity). Within badminton, there are numerous key feedback systems that are crucial when it comes to building up skill and consistency, some which are easy to replicate in VR and some which are completely impossible. Our team took a two sided approach to this problem; the first being utilizing tools within VR to simulate realistic feedback from playing badminton, and the second being using tools within VR to augment the player experience and give addional forms of feedback to boost player understanding.

                      Badminton as a fast paced sport requires players to deeply engage with their senses of touch, sight and sound. For instance, the moment in which an experienced player hits the birdie they can tell whether it was a poor shot based on the haptics of raquet as well as the sound of the birdie bouncing off the strings. However, VR as a platform is still limited in how well it can replicate these senses. Due to this, our team focused mostly on the audio and visual effects of badminton. Visually, this was the importance of the badminton physics system such that the player can tell where their shot landed and how to adjust themselves. Auditorily, sound effects were added for when the birdie collided with the racket and the floor in order reflect its state.

                      In lieu of simulating realistic feedback, our team opted to look into how we could substutute the lost information with other forms of feedback. For instance, the combination of both haptics and audio is used in badminton to tell how much force a player puts into their shot. Our means of simulating this information was with a colored trail on the birdie. Having a trail made the flight path of the bird easier to observe and reflect on, and using color scale indicating speed on the trail helped players understand how quickly the bird was traveling.

                      Still, using visuals only it was still difficult to tell where the birdie landed and whether the player made a good or bad shot. Additional sound effects, one generically good and one generically bad, were implemented in order to build up this distiction. In addition, the negative sound effect also helped build up the player's sense of loss aversion, a trait that is important in competitive play.

                      Going a step further, we wanted to see if we could give advice that a player practicing on their own in real life would not normally notice. Within badminton, one of the most basic mistakes is in the stroke. Unlike in tennis, optimal way to hit a birdie is not by swinging the entire arm, but by flicking the wrist, using the raquet as a lever to hit the birdie at a high speed. To track this, we implemented a system that would track the relative velocity of the player’s controller to the head of their racquet. If the simulation detected both were traveling at roughly the same speed at the moment of impact, then the we knew that the player is not getting the maximum power out of their shot and can notify them to check their form.

            <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              Within the scope of 1 semester, our team was able to break new ground both development and design wise in the context of emulating badminton. However, there is a lot that can still be done in this space. What would an effective training experience look like with the given tools? What is the return on effectiveness with improving the accuracy of simulation, from an auditory as well as a physics standpoint? What are other ways we can gain insight from a players actions and provide even more helpful augmented feedback? With the incresing accessibility of VR, this area is ripe for more exploration.
