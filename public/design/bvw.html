          <h3>Contributions</h3>
          <ul class="cotributions">
            <li>Cooperatively and iterativelly designed 5 games, each within a 1-3 week sprint.</li>
            <li>Served as one of two programmers on each team.</li>
            <li>Lead production dependant on team composition per round.</li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Building Virtual Worlds is a roughly 24hr/week class taught the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center down in Pittsburgh. The goal of the class is to get its students ideating and iterating - fast - and does so by grouping up students and have them go through 5 separate projects over 10 weeks, each project with a new team and a new challenge. After the 5 sprints, the class votes on approximately 20 of the best projects throughout the semester to receive an extra 2 weeks time to iterate and develop for a virtual showcase featuring faculty, family, alumni, and industry professionals.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            The challenges in BVW can be separated into two categories: Overarching challenges applicable to every sprint, and challenges specific to a certain round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the overarching challenges in part came from the design of the class, as well as the context in which the class was running. Some of the significant challenges were as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid prototyping: 1 game every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Adjusting to new teams and establishing pipeline quickly</li>
            <li>Working remotely in a global context</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Rapid prototyping is the main learning objective of this class. For a typical 2 week sprint, there was 1 week between the team roster and project prompt release and the first milestone, which was an in-class playtest showcase, and then another week until the game was played by a naive guest.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the hidden challenges of BVW, however, is the team switch ups that happen in between every round. While each team consisted of 2 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 sound designer, the skills of each member varied significantly, with some teams having no 3D artists in a round featuring VR, and some teams with really strong 3D artists but less strong programmers. But beyond that, there is the issue that different people have different working habits, and accommodating that in order to run efficiently as possible from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last challenge was largely a factor of COVID 19, which caused many technical challenges. Many of these challenges were related to the need to adapt pipeline and workflow to time zone differences, but also extended to the technical capabilities of the hardware and software team members had on hand, and how to work around these restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Round specific challenges are listed as follows. Each challenge will be expanded upon in a project page of its own, so check out those entries if the challenges seem particularly interesting.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Designing for emotion: How to convey fear</li>
            <li>Indirect control: Guiding guests without explicit directions</li>
            <li>Lighting round: 1 week 1 game</li>
            <li>Story: Developing immersive yet contained narratives</li>
            <li>Festival: Designing for multiple concurrent users and audiences</li>
          </ol>
