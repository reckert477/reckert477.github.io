          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Building Virtual Worlds is a class taught the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center down in Pittsburgh. The goal of the class is to get its students ideating and iterating - fast - and does so by grouping up students and have them go through 5 separate projects over 10 weeks, each project with a new team and a new challenge. After the 5 sprints, the class votes on approximately 20 of the best projects throughout the semester to receive an extra 2 weeks time to iterate and develop for a virtual showcase featuring faculty, family, alumni, and industry professionals.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            BVW is the crash course stress test for all students to both expose scenarios to students for them to overcome as well as to push students to hone their skills in a collaborative setting. As someone who has both taken and TAed the class, there are a lot of powerful lessons to be learned simply by doing the work over and over again.

                    The core concept of this class learning to prototype and iterate quickly. For a 2 week project, teams are expected to have a playable deliverable by halfway. The thing about such a chaotic process is that there really is no one way to go about it. Dependent on team strengths and personalities, strategies that work in one team can be completely ineffective in another team with no fault to the team members. As such, the best takeaways are general heuristics as well as an arsenal of different strategies and the understanding of when to use each one. From what I've observed, each project tends to go a phase of ideation, a phase of initial development, and then a phase of refinement, so this section will be structured as such.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Ideation</h4>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the messiest part of every single round is figuring out where to start. Being under high pressure can really go both ways in terms of productivity at this stage. Studies have shown that being under stress reduces creative thinking, thus impeding the ability to collaboratively generate ideas and come to terms with each others visions. However, it's also the case that pressure brings forth diamonds, in the shape of epiphanies and moments of brilliance. There's really no knowing where the ball will fall before it actually happens. Here are some takeaways about how to navigate this part of the project.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The Golden Rule - Fail Fast and Follow the Fun: What's fun rarely makes cognitive sense. Yet the most important measure of a game's success is whether people feel engrossed and engaged, whether they are having fun. </li>
                    <li>Everyone needs to have a stake: Building a game is a team effort and everyone needs to be involved. Otherwise there is no chance that anyone will do their best work if they feel excluded, or don't share at least a partial vision of what everyone is trying to build.</li>
                    <li>Everyone needs to be heard: Building off the last point, this is even more tricky. Some people are vocal while being okay with anything. Some people are not vocal while still being okay with everything. Some people have hidden feelings. Some people have mild feelings that just never have the chance to come up in conversation. Creating scenarios and instances where everyone is polled fairly, whether through voting or just going around in a circle, is critical for keeping the team on the same page conceptually.</li>
                    <li>When you have an abundance of ideas - strip: Truthfully, there is no clean way to mash two ideas together. Despite being able to meld aspects of a game together, the two idea owners will hone in on their own vision, which will eventually lead to dissonance. Stripping ideas down to their essence of "what makes you in love with this concept" better allows other team members to understand what values are important, which creates ground for better incorporation or to synthesize a new combined concept.</li>
                    <li>When you have a dearth of ideas - play: A lack of ideas can really come about by no one's fault, but being in this situation can be a negative feedback loop as the people can become more stressed and more critical. Social activities can often reduce stress and bring up points of commonality. Casually recounting on moments of recent play and simplifying focus on just something fun instead of an entire concept can also help in simply gaining a starting point for the team.</li>
                    <li>Any Visualizations Help: Programmers especially might be hesitant on this one but being able to sketch and block out what situations might look like is a fantastic help. Creating a sketch also helps bring about a point of focus for the team, which is useful for narrowing scope and focusing on specific interactions.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>Early Development</h4>
                  <p>
                    Due to the nature of a short timeline, everybody has to work in parallel. This makes development difficult for a number of reasons, but the biggest is that you haven't yet seen what your teammates have created to base your own decisions off of. Often this means that assets aren't accounted for, or there isn't enough time to make the assets requested. Here are some strategies to ease with the early development.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Staying on the Same Page: One of the best ways to set the team up for success is to come out of the ideation page, such that everyone does have a stake and the vision is more consistent. This least to team members being able to better anticipate and prepare for eventual needs.</li>
                    <li>Early Incorperation: With multiple programmers on the team, at least one programmer should be keeping an eye towards integration. Often times, the core gameplay loop intersects with the most important assets, but having awareness helps gives more foresight to the artist team for how they might need to adjust.</li>
                    <li>Placeholders and Mockups: Despite the need to incorporate art early, the programmer team should never be waiting strictly on art. </li>
                    <li>Pivot as Needed, Carefully: During the 1 week feedback session, some parts of the game will inevitably not come across as intended. Sometime this really is because one crucial feature or asset is missing, but sometimes there may actually be a design flaw within the game. The best (but not always feasible) way to handle this situation is to try and run a test with a better placeholder and see if that resolve the issue. If not possible, then it really come down to a call from the team. Some times a hard pivot can be a good move is something more interesting does come up. Otherwise, a scope reduction is often a good idea to retain the spirit of the original concept.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>Refinement</h4>
                  <p>
                    For a two week project, refinement is a term to be taken loosely. But the truth of the matter is that by the deadline there has to be an experience packed into a single package. It's within this phase of the round in which the team really has to prioritize what makes it into the final build and what has to be compromised. Here are some lessons learned about managing those decisions.

                    The process of ideation quickly is hard, yes, but one of the biggest unspoken challenges are the people you work with. This is not meant in a demeaning way - rather, for every round we were paired up with an entirely new team, and within the two weeks had to cooperate enough to collectively build a game. Each team member brings not only their own skill set, but also their own preferred working styles, their own outlooks, and their own personalities all of which make collaborating non-trivial.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Collaboration</h4>

                    Despite being the literal assignment, the round constraints are arguably secondary to the experience of simply building a game 5 independent times. Though if we were to go through 5 rounds of learning games, we might as well be prompted to try something different each time. Here are the 5 round constraints and the learning they were meant to induce.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Round 1: Conveying Fear</h4>
                  <i>Character A is afraid of character B. The player must help character A achieve their goals and overcome their fear.</i>

            Many of the overarching challenges in part came from the design of the class, as well as the context in which the class was running. Some of the significant challenges were as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid prototyping: 1 game every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Adjusting to new teams and establishing pipeline quickly</li>
            <li>Working remotely in a global context</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Rapid prototyping is the main learning objective of this class. For a typical 2 week sprint, there was 1 week between the team roster and project prompt release and the first milestone, which was an in-class playtest showcase, and then another week until the game was played by a naive guest.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the hidden challenges of BVW, however, is the team switch ups that happen in between every round. While each team consisted of 2 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 sound designer, the skills of each member varied significantly, with some teams having no 3D artists in a round featuring VR, and some teams with really strong 3D artists but less strong programmers. But beyond that, there is the issue that different people have different working habits, and accommodating that in order to run efficiently as possible from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last challenge was largely a factor of COVID 19, which caused many technical challenges. Many of these challenges were related to the need to adapt pipeline and workflow to time zone differences, but also extended to the technical capabilities of the hardware and software team members had on hand, and how to work around these restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Round specific challenges are listed as follows. Each challenge will be expanded upon in a project page of its own, so check out those entries if the challenges seem particularly interesting.
