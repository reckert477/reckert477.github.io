          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Building Virtual Worlds is a class taught the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center down in Pittsburgh. The goal of the class is to get its students ideating and iterating - fast - and does so by grouping up students and have them go through 5 separate projects over 10 weeks, each project with a new team and a new challenge. After the 5 sprints, the class votes on approximately 20 of the best projects throughout the semester to receive an extra 2 weeks time to iterate and develop for a virtual showcase featuring faculty, family, alumni, and industry professionals.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            BVW is the crash course stress test for all students to both expose scenarios to students for them to overcome as well as to push students to hone their skills in a collaborative setting. As someone who has both taken and TAed the class, there are a lot of powerful lessons to be learned simply by doing the work over and over again.

                    The core concept of this class learning to prototype and iterate quickly. For a 2 week project, teams are expected to have a playable deliverable by halfway. The thing about such a chaotic process is that there really is no one way to go about it. Dependent on team strengths and personalities, strategies that work in one team can be completely ineffective in another team with no fault to the team members. As such, the best takeaways are general heuristics as well as an arsenal of different strategies and the understanding of when to use each one. From what I've observed, each project tends to go a phase of ideation, a phase of initial development, and then a phase of refinement, so this section will be structured as such.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Ideation</h4>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the messiest part of every single round is figuring out where to start. Being under high pressure can really go both ways in terms of productivity at this stage. Studies have shown that being under stress reduces creative thinking, thus impeding the ability to collaboratively generate ideas and come to terms with each others visions. However, it's also the case that pressure brings forth diamonds, in the shape of epiphanies and moments of brilliance. There's really no knowing where the ball will fall before it actually happens. Here are some takeaways about how to navigate this part of the project.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The Golden Rule - Fail Fast and Follow the Fun: What's fun rarely makes cognitive sense. Yet the most important measure of a game's success is whether people feel engrossed and engaged, whether they are having fun. </li>
                    <li>Everyone needs to have a stake: Building a game is a team effort and everyone needs to be involved. Otherwise there is no chance that anyone will do their best work if they feel excluded, or don't share at least a partial vision of what everyone is trying to build.</li>
                    <li>Everyone needs to be heard: Building off the last point, this is even more tricky. Some people are vocal while being okay with anything. Some people are not vocal while still being okay with everything. Some people have hidden feelings. Some people have mild feelings that just never have the chance to come up in conversation. Creating scenarios and instances where everyone is polled fairly, whether through voting or just going around in a circle, is critical for keeping the team on the same page conceptually.</li>
                    <li>When you have an abundance of ideas - strip: Truthfully, there is no clean way to mash two ideas together. Despite being able to meld aspects of a game together, the two idea owners will hone in on their own vision, which will eventually lead to dissonance. Stripping ideas down to their essence of "what makes you in love with this concept" better allows other team members to understand what values are important, which creates ground for better incorporation or to synthesize a new combined concept.</li>
                    <li>When you have a dearth of ideas - play: A lack of ideas can really come about by no one's fault, but being in this situation can be a negative feedback loop as the people can become more stressed and more critical. Social activities can often reduce stress and bring up points of commonality. Casually recounting on moments of recent play and simplifying focus on just something fun instead of an entire concept can also help in simply gaining a starting point for the team.</li>
                    <li>Any Visualizations Help: Programmers especially might be hesitant on this one but being able to sketch and block out what situations might look like is a fantastic help. Creating a sketch also helps bring about a point of focus for the team, which is useful for narrowing scope and focusing on specific interactions.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>Early Development</h4>
                  <p>
                    Due to the nature of a short timeline, everybody has to work in parallel. This makes development difficult for a number of reasons, but the biggest is that you haven't yet seen what your teammates have created to base your own decisions off of. Often this means that assets aren't accounted for, or there isn't enough time to make the assets requested. Here are some strategies to ease with the early development.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Staying on the Same Page: One of the best ways to set the team up for success is to come out of the ideation page, such that everyone does have a stake and the vision is more consistent. This least to team members being able to better anticipate and prepare for eventual needs.</li>
                    <li>Early Incorperation: With multiple programmers on the team, at least one programmer should be keeping an eye towards integration. Often times, the core gameplay loop intersects with the most important assets, but having awareness helps gives more foresight to the artist team for how they might need to adjust.</li>
                    <li>Placeholders and Mockups: Despite the need to incorporate art early, the programmer team should never be waiting strictly on art. Having the ability to create low-fi mockups is incredibly helpful, not only in passing blockades, but also in helping artists visualize the context in which their art will be integrated.</li>
                    <li>Pivot as Needed, Carefully: During the 1 week feedback session, some parts of the game will inevitably not come across as intended. Sometime this really is because one crucial feature or asset is missing, but sometimes there may actually be a design flaw within the game. The best (but not always feasible) way to handle this situation is to try and run a test with a better placeholder and see if that resolve the issue. If not possible, then it really come down to a call from the team. Some times a hard pivot can be a good move is something more interesting does come up. Otherwise, a scope reduction is often a good idea to retain the spirit of the original concept.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>Refinement</h4>
                  <p>
                    For a two week project, refinement is a term to be taken loosely. But the truth of the matter is that by the deadline there has to be an experience packed into a single package. It's within this phase of the round in which the team really has to prioritize what makes it into the final build and what has to be compromised, so there's less generalized advice to be derived here. Regardless, here are some lessons learned about managing those decisions.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Playtest, Seriously: Save time ideally at least 1 day before the deadline to have someone naive run through the game. Not only does this move the goalpost earlier which leads to getting stable sooner, having at least 1 full naive runthrough will expose an incredible amount of small tweaks that need to be made in order to make the experience remotely smooth.</li>
                    <li>Everyone Makes it In: When it comes down to the final minute, it usually falls on a programmer to integrate all of the parts, but they might not be done writing some functionality. As a baseline, try to get everyone's latest work in first. As the team, you all will understand the game even if it looks bare, but for a naive guest sometimes having a finished visual can do more to tell them who they are and what they are doing as opposed to a missing functionality. However, sometimes assets really do come in late enough that there is no time to integrate, in which at least try to have WIPs or interim work integrated.</li>
                    <li>Submitted is Better than Complete: Unless the project is going horrendously wrong, there should be moments of incremental progress. At least 2 hours before the submission deadline, keep an eye out for any playable version that is remotely stable. If one exists, build and submit that. There can be a lot of variability that pops up in the last hour, so having something in the door is always a good idea.</li>
                  </ol>

                    The process of ideation quickly is hard, yes, but one of the biggest unspoken challenges are the people you work with. This is not meant in a demeaning way - rather, for every round we were paired up with an entirely new team, and within the two weeks had to cooperate enough to collectively build a game. Each team member brings not only their own skill set, but also their own preferred working styles, their own outlooks, and their own personalities all of which make collaborating non-trivial. Since our semester was fully remote, having teammates from all around the world boosted the complexity of cooperation, but also served to give more insight into developing better collaborative skills.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                  <p>
                    The biggest factor controllable factor that influences smooth collaboration is ensuring everyone feels respected and socially secure. There are many ways to build this feeling of respect, some which are more effective depending on the situation. The first meeting of course is incredibly important, since everyone will be wary of the team's social dynamics and will be nervous about what direction to go. Keeping the first meeting light without explicitly diving into icebreakers is a good way to go, since it's good for the team to find common ground organically. Within meetings specifically, letting teammates talk out fully and freely is important. However, it's also a good idea to create segments that ask for every persons' thoughts equally and without judgement. This is important because there can be moments where it is difficult to bring up a dissenting opinion in the heat of discussion, and also because the teams impression of consensus can be heavily skewed based on who is talking. Outside of meetings, it's important to acknowledge each other's work. In many cases, what work your teammates produce might not exactly match your own creative vision. While it's important to acknowledge dissonance and provide feedback, it's also good to see from your teammates perspective about what they were trying to achieve and give credit where credit's due.
                  </p>



                  <h4>Pipelines</h4>
                  <p>
                    A more specific subsection of collaboration is the pipeline, or how different team members' work comes together into the final product. Being remote mattered a lot since it affects how files can be transferred, who has access to which resources, and how the team syncs together. One of the best ways to establish a good starting pipeline is with something BVW calls a "Golden Spike". The golden spike is essentially an artifact that everyone on the team contributes to. Having every team member go through the motions of contributing helps catch whether files are being transferred in the way other team members expect, and if not, what the expectation should be. One round had us shift from using Perforce to Github as our main source control when we found out that one team member got less than 1MB of transfer speeds to the Perforce server. The more normalized a work environment is, the less necessary it is to go through the extent of a full golden spike. However, this tool is incredibly helpful when the entire team is unsure what to expect of each other. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The other spread out a team is amongst locales and especially timezones, the more important syncs become. 
                  </p>

                  <h4>Production</h4>
                  <p>
                    In BVW where the deliverable requirements are fairly freeform, production is mainly directed internally towards ensuring team cohesion. Granted, this still is not a trivial task. While in an ideal team would be completely synergistic, having one person in particular to ensure the team dynamic remains smooth is important. In my opinion, the best way to produce for such teams is to support and enable the team to set them up for success, as opposed to prescribing what how the team should flow. Given this mindset, here are some important notes.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Get really really good at listening. Not just to what your team is verbally saying, but also the team's attitude and whether any team members feel unfairness. A producer is hardly able to fix a problem they don't know about.</li>
                    <li>Be empathetic but be proactive. For myself in particular, as an introvert I often need to remind myself to not be afraid to reach out to individual members if there's a hint of friction. Not all one-on-one conversations need to be action oriented, sometimes just sharing feelings about the task at hand is good enough.</li>
                    <li>Prescribing deadlines is helpful. Deadlines act as scaffolding for the team to understand how much time the should be spending on a particular segment, and when the should be shifting their attention to the next problem.</li>
                    <li>Have contingency plans upon contingency plans. Particularly for key deliverables and deadlines - just because there are deadlines doesn't mean that they will be met. Sometimes letting team members know what the contingency plan is beforehand can be helpful, but sometime it can be a distraction.</li>
                    <li>Bring your tool box of tricks. There are a million ways to foster healthy discussions, to resolve conflicts, and to improve team spirit and morale. Each tool has their time and place. Keep your ears peeled, be willing to pick up new tools along the way, and be humble if one tool didn't work and try the next.</li>
                  </ul>

                    Despite being the literal assignment, the round constraints are arguably secondary to the experience of simply building a game 5 independent times. Though if we were to go through 5 rounds of learning games, we might as well be prompted to try something different each time. Here are the 5 round constraints and the learning they were meant to induce.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Round 1: Conveying Fear</h4>
                  <i>Create a game in which character A is afraid of character B. The player must help character A achieve their goals and overcome their fear.</i>

                        Save doggo is a game about a scientist who goes back in time to when his lab was raided and his dog injured, in order to right the wrongs of his dog sacrificing its well being for them to escape safely. Gameplay features controlling both the scientist and the dog at the same time in order to solve puzzles and escape the lab in time.

                      <p>
                        This game was able to achieve a relatively high degree of polish and was praised for the ludonarrative connection between the scientist and the dog. However, the project did deviate slightly from the prompt since with the game direction, the team decided to focus on overall game cohesion first and foremost.

                        Njord is a game in which the player is the god of wind, who must blow the ship of vikings to a new land. This game tracks the player's facial angle and uses the mic to pick up the sound of the player blowing in order to translate their actions into game input.

                        While ambitions in scope and game feel, this project had a lot of pipeline issues that came with being a smaller team an in 3 timezones each 8 hours apart from each other. The lack of iteration lead to an unnaturally scaffolded experience that was unable to deliver on the intended fantasy.

                        BSing Virtual Worlds is a parody of the Building Virtual Worlds class in that multiple players team up to "build a game" by placing art assets, mechanics, and assigning sound effects before someone must "playtest" their game. Players connect to the game using their phone as a controller over Airconsole, and can scroll through menus to select and move components around a predefined space.

                        BSing Virtual Worlds demonstrated how not resolving working styles beforehand can lead to big delays. Despite having the least time, this round took the longest to decide on an idea to move forward with it, since the team was unable to agree on what constitutes a good concept. However, the result from the chaos was a very novel idea that won the first penguin award for being innovative.

                        Scrapbook is a VR experience that tells the story of a down-on-his-luck movie scriptwriter reminiscing on the highs and lows of his life via a scrapbook. The player takes objects from around the room of his childhood, and puts them in the missing part of his scrapbook, both good and bad memories.

                        This team was able to get on the same page quickly with regards to working styles, which allowed the team to iterate heavily on the narrative, and how it was told through player actions. Good delegation and incremental development helped the team work rapidly and independently and still make contributions up until the last minute.

                        Demon Lord Construction Corporation is a game in which up to 10 demons must build traps in their stronghold to stall the hero from passing through - only that the traps that they and their teammates put together can get in their way! Gameplay features a player dropping in and picking up different materials to put in the hero's pathway.

                        Demon Lord Construction Corporation had the largest up-front technical cost to get prototyped of all aforementioned worlds, due to the multiplayer aspects. With a unique playable concept, this meant that getting enough playtests to understand how our game encouraged player interactions was difficult. While our team was able to playtest enough to make critical decisions, pushing our playtests earlier by using placeholders would have given more time to polish the final gameplay and given more room for tuning.
