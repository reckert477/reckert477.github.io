                  "The Tomb" is one of the more interesting rooms at the Entertainment Technology Center. Intended as a room to practice designing for location based entertainment experiences, it contains just one computer but for two different set pieces. Occupying a majority of the room are these 5 walls with Egyptian hieroglyphics which are enabled by RFID sensors. In a corner is the computer on a steampunk-themed dual-screen kiosk setup with numerous physical switches and a touchscreen. Normally, the computer runs just one of these stations at a time. However, our task was to create an experience that combined the both of them into one conducive experience for two players.

            <h3>Experience Design</h3>

                <p>
                  To make both sets thematically consistent, we decided to settle on a 2 person escape experience, with 1 person being trapped within the tomb and the other piloting an excavation machine to rescue them. Early on we decided that in order to really make the experience feel collaborative, we needed both players to feel equal stake in the experience. Since the kiosk has numerous interfaces compared to the tomb's limited RFID sensors, we decided to have the tomb player primarily control the information in a "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" style experience, with the roles trading off ever so often in order to keep up engagement.

            <h3>Peripherals Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Within the scope of a LBE experience we wanted to capitalize on the existing hardware and peripherals in order to increase immersion. Since the sets are already built, our focus was on using the existing peripherals to support the experience as much as possible. From the beginning of the experience, the first step is to identify when the users are oriented properly in the space. We utilized the pressure sensors in the floor of the hieroglyphic tomb to set the trigger and having the lighting respond to the player's presence brings about the impression that the space is responding to the player within. For the kiosk guest, we asked them to "scan their hand print" on the touchscreen to confirm their presence, and brought the lights up accordingly when they did so.
            </p>
            <p>
              With both players immersed in the experience, our team faced the challenge of ensuring the appropriate set pieces were used at the correct times. Within each moment of interaction, multiple context clues were given to guide the guest towards the appropriate tool and its intended usage. Lighting cues, puzzle clues, and visual hints were added to give guests multiple ways of finding out how and which tools to use. In addition, the experience was built to be responsive to set pieces that weren't intended to be used as well. This helped the experience feel more responsive to guests, while further nudging the guests towards the intended interactions.
