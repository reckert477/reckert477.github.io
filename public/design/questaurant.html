          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Questaurant is the result of a dissertation under Xiaofei Tang about game-based formulaic expressions learning. When learning a language, in this case Chinese, knowledge of context, norms, and social conventions is equally important in communication as vocabulary and grammar themselves. However, when learning a second language removed from its native context, conventions of speaking are often lost. Questaurant was thus an experiment for the feasibility of using games to teach such conventions through simulated environments and natural feedback.
          </p>

          <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            As a client project, there were a number of constraints on what kind of a game we were to make. Non negotiably, our game had to be liner and replicatable in a web based format. This was to ensure that it could still be compared to the control in a meaningful way. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest question in this project was how players would interface with Chinese as a game mechanic. We were largely locked into multiple choice as well as a form of fill in the blank or sentence construction as a form of player input. However, we were open ended on what Chinese did in this world. We played with concept such as using Chinese as sort of a spellcasting language, using it to blend into society / brainwash within a cyberpunk setting, or in the context of fast paced minigames. However, given that being able to distinguish context and norms is an important learning goal, we realized that placing the player in a relatively normal environment was a necessity. Falling back on Self Determination Theory, we decided that the drive to improve at Chinese needs the primary motivation, supported by the rest of the experience. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a secondary form of motivation, we decided to add an inconsequential minigame at the end of every Chinese language scenario. To ensure that this minigame supported the primary motivation, we made the maximum rewards responsive to the player's performance in the respective scenario to encourage the player to do better. In addition, the rewarded currency's only effect on the game is cosmetic. By keeping the rewards inconsequential, we ensure that the motivation for this segment is player intrinsic and thus wouldn't detract from any other player motivations while being able to target more motivating factors for the player.
          </p>

          <h3>Backend Design</h3>
          <p>
            While having a dedicated backend was not in the original specifications, as the design became more fleshed out the importance of having one became more pronounced. The biggest reason was for data collection and aggregation, but creating one also enabled much more efficient pipelines for prototyping and development. In particular setting up a backend was beneficial for our scriptwriter, who was able to work in a spreadsheet like format and have their changes immediately effective in the game. Normalizing scenes, dialogues, and questions within the database also made it significantly easier to playtest scenario order, question order, and overall game flow and rearrange the script quickly and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data was normalized to the third normal form (3NF) in order to allow for easy changes to the script as well as simple and non-redundant data entry from game playthroughs. Within the Unity, care was made to have atomic transactions such that even though playthroughs were proctored, avenues for cheating and data manipulation were mitigated.
