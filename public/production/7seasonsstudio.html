          <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
          <ul class="cotributions">
            <li>Coordinate a team of 3 artist and 3 designers to create a cohesive preproduction package, ready for a dedicated development team to build off of.</li>
            <li>Continually evaluate project needs to identify the next step needed to arrive at a comprehensive idea, and how to get there.</li>
            <li>Use a variety of tools and heuristics to enable team members to work productively in a way that brings more clarity to the project.</li>
            <li>Facilitate collaboration between design and art teams, ensuring that neither has an unhealthy amount of control over the project direction.</li>
            <li>Balance the nebulous nature of concept generation with creating solid deliverables and meeting presentation deadlines.</li>
            <li>Act as point of contact for the team with university faculty and industry experts. Organize feedback from said parties in a digestible and actionable manner for team members.</li>
            <li>Act as moral and emotional support for the team, particularly for when setbacks inevitably occur.</li>
            <li>Distill project findings into a comprehensive report of learnings and takeaways.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Game preproduction is the least defined aspect of game creation, starting from a blank piece of paper and ending with a concept that has enough clarity that an unrelated team can come in and create a complete and cohesive game off of your preproduction package. The process by which this happens is never the same, and comes down to factors of team members' interests, specialties, working styles, and inevitably the idea that is chosen to polish into a game concept. When progress comes and goes on a whim and project direction can change literally overnight, how does one develop systems to methods to arrive at unified preproduction package? Our team aims to find out by going through the preproduction process ourselves. This project has its own website complete with a full postmortem, which you can check out <a rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" target="_blank" href="https://projects.etc.cmu.edu/7-seasons-studio/">here</a>!
          </p>

          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>Coming into the project knowing how volatile it would be, I set a couple guiding principles for myself.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Prioritize enabling team members to be productive to their fullest potential.</li>
            <li>Maintain oversight on project direction, ensuring key decisions are made and questions are answered.</li>
            <li>Be open minded in looking for tools, strategies, and external inspiration to overcome team roadblocks.</li>
            <li>Ensure team equality and make sure each team member has a valuable and vital role to play.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            While definitely naive, these principles were important to ensure the project never went completely off the rails, that there would always be a way forward to progress, and that this project would be a valuable learning experience to every team member. From there, I would pull from my producer's bag of tools to choose the course of action that would best suit the team at that moment in time. Playtests, design exercises, player stories, would all be used in conjunction with standard tools such as the scrum framework to guide team progress.
          </p>

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            A more thorough explanation can be found on the project website, but this project could be generally broken down into 3 phases: Concept Generation, Game Loop Identification, and Concept Clarification. Concept generation consists of identifying the main player fantasy, and figuring out how and what a potential player would feel when going through this experience. Game loop identification involves taking this concept and translating it into player verbs, a gameplay loop, and further finding ways to reinforce the core fantasy. Concept clarification is then the process of refining the concept to be cohesive, trimming of aspects that don't fit and making pivots that bring clarity to the player's role and presence in the game. That being said, at any point in the project is the concept subject to change. The decision to make a change must be thoughtful, but also swift and bold to ensure the team doesn't stall as well as gain a clearer direction of where to go. Listed below are various different strategies used to guide the team through various phases of the project.

                    Despite being the literal assignment, the round constraints are arguably secondary to the experience of simply building a game 5 independent times. Though if we were to go through 5 rounds of learning games, we might as well be prompted to try something different each time. Here are the 5 round constraints and the learning they were meant to induce.
