          </ul>

          <h3>Key Event Director Responsibilities</h3>
          <ul class="cotributions">
            <li>Act as a point of contact with clients about their event requests, identifying scope, determining feasibility, and anticipating any potential complications.</li>
            <li>Recruit and organize a run crew of specialized technicians to handle various audiovisual aspects of the event.</li>
            <li>Establish and track timeline leading up to the event, factoring for various runcrew dependencies.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            AB Tech acts as an in-house production company for Carnegie Mellon University. AB Tech takes on all sorts of event request ranging from small microphone and speaker for music, to helping run concerts, fashion shows, and even orientation and high profile administration events. Clocking in at over 200 events a year, the logistics required to not only run the organization, but also continually train new technicians, manage in house equipment, and maintain professional relations are immense.
          </p>

          <h3>Organizational Breakdown</h3>
          <p>
            Due to the high volume of requests and limited working capacity of students, an efficient system of handling event requests is used. When an event request is received, a member of AB Tech will apply to be the <b>event director</b>. Event directors are thus in charge of every aspect of their event going forward, from client communications to putting together a team of technicians to event operation and billing. Part of the responsibilities of the president and organization officers is to ensure that all events are accounted for and that event directors have the tools they need to support the event. However, the two roles are not mutually exclusive. In terms of being an AB Tech technician, officers are no different in applying for event director positions or any technician role required to support an event. 
          </p>

          <h3>Contributions as President</h3>
          <p>
            My term as president was during the COVID pandemic. As such, most of my focus was on retaining institutional knowledge despite a lack of events to train newer members on as well as converting operations to a hybrid format.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spearheaded initiative to create more and higher quality training for basic technician knowledge as well as specialized lighting and audio knowledge.</li>
            <li>Documented and archived trainings in a way that they can be used for future reference.</li>
            <li>Personally constructed and ran multiple training sessions, accounting for ways to interactively participate remotely.</li>
            <li>Improved accessibility of basic AB Tech information to new members.</li>
            <li>Communicated with university about changing COVID operation policies, generated workflows that enabled AB Tech to get approval for in person operations.</li>
            <li>Added structure to AB Tech meeting and update cycles to better keep officers and event directors responsible and accountable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Contributions as Event Director and Technician</h3>
          <p>
            Compared to my time as president, I spent significantly more time on the ground supporting events by working with clients and leading a team of technicians to reliably support all natures of event requests.
